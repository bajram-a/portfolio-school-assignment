        <h1>Simle Age Game</h1>
        <p>
            This is one of the first things I ever made. As the name suggests it's a very simple console application written in C# 
            that demonstartes some of the basic things you can do in C# (or any other programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
            The app asks a user to input their date of birth and offers him a choice to find out exactly how old he is expressed 
            in different units of time.
        </p> 
        <p>
            While it sounds simple (maybe because it is), it manages to showcase a lot features like conditionals, branching, 
            methods, variable parsing etc. The full "app" can be found on github.
