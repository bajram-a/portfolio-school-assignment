                <p>Microsoft today made a number of developer-oriented announcements that continue its theme of the last few years: 
                    the company wants its tools—and ultimately its platforms, especially Azure—to be the choice of every developer, 
                    no matter which languages and tools they use and no matter what platform they ultimately deploy on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The centerpiece of Microsoft's developer tools remains Visual Studio, and a first preview of its 2019 edition is 
                    now available to download. It integrates the awesome Live Share feature first demonstrated last year and expands 
                    IntelliCode, a machine-learning-driven extension to the IntelliSense developer assistance that's been a part of 
                    Visual Studio for ages. IntelliCode examines source code repositories to build models of a range of different 
                    things, from code formatting preferences to library usage and development patterns.
                    Currently, IntelliCode works with C# in Visual Studio and Python in Visual Studio Code. It does so by using 
                    GitHub's open source repositories as its training data. Visual Studio 2019 expands this to enable analysis of 
                    private repositories. It also increases the language compatibility; Visual Studio will add C++ and XAML support, 
                    while Visual Studio Code will pick up JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java support.
                </p>
                <p>A preview of Visual Studio 2019 for Mac is also available.</p>
                <h2>Open source and cross platform</h2>
                <p>
                    On the .NET front, .NET Core 2.2—the open source .NET platform that spans Windows, macOS, and Linux—is 
                    now generally available. Perhaps more significant, however, is the first preview of .NET Core 3.0, which will 
                    include support for both the WinForms and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) graphical interface frameworks. 
                    This in turn means that, for the first time, Microsoft will be open sourcing those frameworks. WinForms will be 
                    available immediately; WPF will be opened up in phases over the coming weeks. Both of these toolkits are now 
                    under the stewardship and control of the .NET Foundation. Also being opened up is WinUI, a set of controls for 
                    writing UWP applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The .NET Foundation is also changing its membership model to increase the representation of open source 
                    contributors. The board is being expanded from three to seven members, and anybody who has contributed to the 
                    .NET Foundation's open source development is eligible to be elected. Individual open source contributors are 
                    also eligible to join the Foundation as members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of this, a bunch of Azure services have been updated. A range of machine-learning and cognitive services 
                    have been updated to both expand the capabilities within the cloud and increase the number of machine-learning 
                    tasks that can be pushed to edge devices.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Azure DevOps, the set of componentized application lifecycle management services, is also seeing new 
                    features: Azure Boards, which provides dashboards and reporting for projects, now integrates with GitHub 
                    Issues. Azure Pipelines, the build/test/deploy service, now has a Visual Studio extension to make designing 
                    workflows easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Microsoft is also rolling out new options for serverless applications and containerized applications. 
                    There's a preview of Kubernetes cluster scaling, a preview of GPU-accelerated containers, and a preview 
                    version of a Linux-hosted version of Azure Functions, which provides the same pay-per-execution model as 
                    the current non-Linux Azure Functions service. Python can now also be used to write Functions—er, functions—in 
                    a new public preview.
