            My name is Ahmed Bajramovic, I was born on 18th of July 1997 in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
            Ever since I was little I was interested in texh, bot the hardware and software side, but I never fully committed to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I finished "Novi Grad" primary school, followed by the "Behram-begova Medresa" high school where I was top of my class.
            After that I spent a year studying Turkish in Istanbul in preparation for studying International Relations at the 
            prestigious "Marmara" university. At the same time I started learning programming, begginning with C# basics and 
            continueing on from that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along the way I had various short-term jobs that tought me much about dealing with peaople, especially my 
            time working as a tour guide in Istanbul.
        </p>

        <p>
            After second semester of college I made the decision to abandon my IR studies, and continue studying programming at 
            the Faculty of Science in Sarajevo. Looking back this was probably he best decision of my life.
